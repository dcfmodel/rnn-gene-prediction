COMMENT     PROVISIONAL REFSEQ: This record has not yet been subject to final
            NCBI review. The reference sequence was derived from BA000002.
            On Nov 28, 2006 this sequence version replaced gi:14600379.
            Kawarabayasi, Y. is at National Institute of Advanced Industrial
            Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8566, Japan.
            Tanaka, T., Hino, Y., Kawarabayasi, Y. and Kikuchi, H. are original
            submitters.
            Tajima, T., Sekigawa, T., Oguchi, A., Yamazaki, S., Tanikawa, S.,
            Fujita, N. and Harayama S. submitted a revised version of the
            genomic sequence with a single bp insertion and the result of
            reannotation.
            The genome of A. pernix was completely re-annotated in May 2006.
            Single nucleotide was inserted at position 941,216. Some ORFs were
            added or modified according to the result of proteome analysis at
            NITE (Yamazaki, S. et al., Mol Cell Proteomics. 5, 811-823 (2006)).
            The detailed process of re-annotation is described in
            http://www.bio.nite.go.jp/dogan/GeneralFeature?GENOME_ID=ape_G1.
            All locus tags of A. pernix were replaced to new identifiers by the
            following rules.
            1. Prefix 'APE' or 'APES' was replaced by 'APE_'.
            2. ORF numbers were inherited except for those with previous locus
            tag starting with 'APES'.
            3. An alphabetical character like 'a' was added after the ORF
            number where new ORF was inserted between existing ORFs, including
            those with previous locus tag starting with 'APES'. 4. Version
            number like '.1' was added where the start position of existing ORF
            was changed.
